Features to add ...
- implement mouse movement tracking
	- implement virtual trackball
- render control points
	- make them interactive

Things I should do ...
- change vertex rendering into filled polygon rendering
- look into used memory, CG seems to kick in regularly ;-)

Things I need to do, but are not really critical right now ;-)

- implement support for rendering "crisp" lines
- implement everything with arrays, hashes are rather expensive
