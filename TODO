Features to add ...
- implement mouse movement tracking
	- implement virtual trackball
- render control points
	- make them interactive
- add support for Splines & NURBS

Things I should do ...
- change vertex rendering into filled polygon rendering
- look into used memory, CG seems to kick in regularly ;-)

Things I need to do, but are not really critical right now ;-)
- implement support for rendering "crisp" lines
- implement everything with arrays, hashes are rather expensive
- add some HTML to "build"/"inspect" scenes

Things I might do ...
- add a Sphere Shape
- hidden line removal
